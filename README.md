# Executive Summary: AI Governance at Speed

## Bridging Governance Requirements and Developer Velocity with Foundry Citadel Platform

---

## The AI Governance Imperative

As AI systems become more powerful and integrated into everyday life, **governance is no longer a "nice-to-have"; it's a must**. Whether you're aligning to emerging regulations like the EU AI Act, meeting internal standards for risk and safety, or ensuring your AI systems are meeting your enterprise's business goals with scale and efficiency, the ability to govern AI responsibly at speed is a game-changer.

---

## The Governance-Velocity Paradox

Yet, **governance and developer velocity often feel fundamentally misaligned**. Organizations face critical bottlenecks:

- **Manual Risk Assessments**: Frequently time-consuming and lacking standardization
- **Scattered Evaluation Tools**: Fragmented across different teams and systems
- **Unclear Governance Requirements**: Ambiguous policies that are difficult to operationalize
- **Implementation Gaps**: Policies rarely map cleanly to real-world technical implementation

**The result?** Bottlenecks and delays that frustrate both governance teams and developers, slowing AI adoption and increasing organizational risk.

---

## The Collaboration Challenge

Effective AI governance demands a new balance—**one that enforces oversight without impeding innovation**. It also requires multiple stakeholders collaborating effectively with each other:

### 👔 **Compliance Officers & Chief AI Officers**
Must determine **what needs to be assessed** to comply with company policies and regulations

### 👨‍💻 **AI Developers & Engineering Teams**
Need to **operationalize these requirements** by generating the right qualitative and quantitative evidence

**Unfortunately**, the handshake between these personas is often not smooth and can create friction in the governance process. Traditional methods tend to create friction, slowing down deployment or leading to incomplete compliance. **It's a trade-off most organizations can no longer afford.**
